# tools

A collection of single-file HTML tools, built with the help of LLMs.

Each tool is a self-contained HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript—no build step required. Host them anywhere, copy them anywhere, modify them easily.

## About

This repository follows a philosophy of **single-file simplicity**:

- Every tool is one `.html` file
- No build step, no bundlers, no frameworks
- Dependencies loaded from CDNs when needed
- Tools are small enough for any LLM to read and modify

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for instructions on creating new tools.
