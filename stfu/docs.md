Audio feedback looper that captures microphone input and plays it back with a configurable delay. Features two modes: Simple Delay (hear yourself once after a delay) and Echo Loop (audio repeats and gradually fades). The delayed auditory feedback (DAF) effect can disrupt speech fluency, making it useful for... encouraging others to be quiet. Works best with headphones to prevent actual audio feedback loops.
